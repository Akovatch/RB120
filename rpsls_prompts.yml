  "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" is an expansion
  of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors."

  As Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory explains:
  "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes
  lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors,
  scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper
  disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always
  has...rock crushes scissors."

  Don't worry if you can't remember all of this - the game
  will announce the winner of each round automatically!
